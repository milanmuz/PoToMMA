## A Musicological Analysis of Max Reger's *Sechs Burlesken*, Op. 58, No. 4

This report presents a comprehensive musicological analysis of the piece represented by the MIDI file 'Sechs burlesken Max Reger', likely the fourth burlesque from Max Reger's Op. 58, a set of six for piano. The analysis integrates findings derived from automated MIDI processing, focusing on form, tonality, structure, compositional techniques, and historical context.

### 1. Historical Context and Stylistic Overview

Max Reger (1873-1916) stands as a pivotal figure in late German Romanticism, bridging the gap between the monumentalism of Wagner and Brahms and the emergent modernisms of the early 20th century. Known for his prodigious output, particularly in organ and chamber music, and his masterful command of counterpoint and harmony, Reger's style is characterized by extreme chromaticism, dense textures, and a profound engagement with traditional forms, even as he stretched their harmonic boundaries. The "Burleske" genre, typically light, witty, and often virtuosic, provided Reger with a canvas for his elaborate harmonic explorations within a compact, often capricious, structure. This piece, a piano reduction, showcases the intricate layering and harmonic richness typical of his solo piano works.

### 2. Form and Structure

The piece, comprising 49 measures and a total duration of 204.0 Quarter Lengths, suggests a concise, single-movement form, consistent with one piece from a set of "Burlesken." Its structure is primarily articulated through shifts in time signature and tempo, indicating distinct sections.

The initial section is established in **4/4 time** with a brisk tempo of 110 bpm, sustained for the majority of the piece's opening. A significant structural marker occurs at **Offset 128.00**, where the time signature abruptly shifts to **6/4**. This change, accompanied by a noticeable deceleration of tempo (gradually from 85 bpm down to 66 bpm), signals a contrasting middle section (B). This expressive slowdown, featuring multiple granular tempo indications, highlights a moment of lyrical or reflective departure from the initial driving character.

Following this, at **Offset 134.00**, the piece returns to **4/4 time** and the initial 110 bpm, indicating a return to the opening material (A'). This suggests a ternary or ABA' form, a common formal archetype in the Romantic period. A final significant change occurs at **Offset 194.00**, where the time signature expands to an unusual **10/4**. This expansion, occurring towards the very end of the piece, likely serves as a dramatic coda, potentially allowing for broader melodic gestures or a more expansive harmonic progression to conclude the work. The overall structural design, therefore, appears to be a compact ternary form (ABA') with an extended coda.

### 3. Tonality and Harmony

The piece's harmonic language is complex and defies simple categorization, characteristic of Reger's late Romantic idiom.

The **Initial Key Signature** is given as "D- major" with "-5 sharps/flats." It is important to clarify that "-5 sharps/flats" corresponds to **D-flat major** (Db major), rather than D minor (D-). While the presence of Db major as the notated key implies a tonal center, the analysis reveals significant chromatic complexity that challenges a straightforward functional interpretation.

The **Global Key Correlation Score of -1.00** is a striking indicator. This low score suggests that the piece, when analyzed by an automated system, does not adhere strongly or consistently to a single diatonic key. For a composer like Reger, this is not evidence of atonality in the Schoenbergian sense, but rather of **expanded tonality** or **pan-tonality**. Reger often saturates the tonal landscape with so much chromaticism, passing modulations, and enharmonic equivalents that a definitive, unchanging tonal center becomes elusive over longer spans, even if local functional progressions are at play.

Examination of the **Pitch Class Distribution** supports this view:
*   PC 5 (F) is the most frequent (12.5%), followed by PC 10 (Bb, 11.4%), PC 3 (Eb, 9.6%), PC 0 (C, 9.2%), and PC 9 (A, 9.1%).
*   The least common is PC 11 (B, 5.0%).
*   While all 12 pitch classes are present in significant quantities, the distribution is uneven, with a **Standard Deviation of 57.19**. This asymmetry demonstrates that the piece is *not* freely atonal or serial, where one might expect a more even distribution of pitch classes. Instead, the prominence of F, Bb, Eb, C, and A, within the initial Db major context, suggests an emphasis on scale degrees related to Db major (F is the mediant, Bb the submediant, Eb the supertonic, C the leading tone). The high incidence of F# (PC 6, 6.8%) and C# (PC 1, 9.1%) further underscores pervasive chromaticism and frequent use of altered chords or distant tonal areas.

The **Most Common Chords** list provides further insight into Reger's dense harmonic vocabulary:
*   The prevalence of "F other" (67 occurrences) and "B- other" (57 occurrences) indicates frequent use of chords built on F and Bb, which are prominent scale degrees in Db major. The term "other" implies extended, altered, or non-triadic harmonies, often chords with added tensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) or chromatic alterations (e.g., augmented sixth chords, highly altered dominants), characteristic of late Romantic harmony.
*   The presence of traditional major and minor triads like F major (32 occurrences), C minor (30 occurrences), and E- major (26 occurrences) confirms that conventional tertian harmony forms a foundation, even if often obscured or intensified by chromaticism.
*   The frequent appearance of chords on F#, G#, C#, and E- again points to a highly chromatic palette, with rapid modulations or extended harmonies that venture far from the diatonic comfort zone of Db major.

The **Percentage of Dissonant Intervals at 20.9%** is notable but not excessive for a late Romantic work. This indicates that while dissonance is a significant element, it is integrated into the harmonic fabric, often used for expressive tension and color, and likely resolving or moving to other dissonances rather than being entirely "emancipated" from its traditional role. The **Top 10 Melodic/Simultaneous Intervals** further elaborates this:
*   The dominance of Perfect Octaves (P8: 376 occurrences), minor Thirds (m3: 230 occurrences), and Major Thirds (M3: 161 occurrences) reveals a continued reliance on consonant intervals and tertian harmony.
*   Perfect Fourths (P4: 127 occurrences) and Perfect Fifths (P5: 66 occurrences) also demonstrate a foundation in traditional counterpoint and chordal construction.
*   Crucially, the significant presence of Augmented Seconds (A2: 97 occurrences) and Diminished Fourths (d4: 85 occurrences) highlights Reger's penchant for chromatic, expressive voice leading and the use of characteristic late-Romantic sonorities such as augmented sixth chords, Neapolitan chords, or diminished seventh chords, which generate these highly colorful intervals.

In summary, the tonal character of this Reger Burleske is one of **highly chromatic functional tonality**. While an initial key of D-flat major is suggested, the constant flux of tonal centers, the saturation of all twelve pitch classes, and the prevalence of altered and extended chords create a rich, dense harmonic environment that often blurs traditional diatonic boundaries. The music does not abandon tonal gravity but stretches it to its breaking point, frequently implying, but rarely firmly establishing, a single tonal center for extended periods. Modality might be hinted at through specific chord choices or melodic fragments, but the overwhelming impression is of a pan-tonal approach where a broad spectrum of keys and sonorities are explored within an overarching, albeit highly flexible, tonal framework.

### 4. Compositional Techniques

The analysis points to several key compositional techniques:

*   **Pervasive Chromaticism:** This is the most defining feature. Every pitch class is utilized frequently, leading to a rich and often ambiguous harmonic landscape. This chromaticism extends beyond simple passing tones, infiltrating the very structure of chords and progressions.
*   **Expanded Harmonic Vocabulary:** The significant number of "other" chords indicates a reliance on extended tertian harmonies, altered chords (e.g., altered dominants), and potentially non-functional sonorities that add color and tension without always adhering to traditional voice-leading rules of resolution.
*   **Complex Rhythmic Design:** The fluid and irregular tempo changes, coupled with shifts in time signature (4/4, 6/4, 10/4), suggest a highly dynamic and nuanced rhythmic profile. This rhythmic flexibility is crucial for expressive performance and contributes to the "burlesque" character, allowing for moments of capriciousness, rubato, and dramatic shifts in momentum.
*   **Non-Serial Approach:** The "Twelve-Tone Analysis by Segment" provides a definitive finding: **no contiguous 12-tone rows (all 12 unique pitch classes) were found in any segment of the piece.** This is a critical conclusion. It unequivocally demonstrates that Reger did not employ the strict twelve-tone technique or serialism as developed later by Schoenberg. His exploration of all 12 pitch classes is a result of extreme chromaticism within an extended tonal system, not systematic serialization. The analysis correctly labels the *absence* of rows as indicating "free atonality, pitch-class set theory, or other non-strict serial techniques," but in the context of Reger, it must be interpreted as **highly chromatic tonal music** rather than atonality. Reger's compositions predate the widespread adoption of atonality and serialism.

While not explicitly verifiable from the MIDI data provided, Reger's known style also implies:
*   **Dense Counterpoint:** Reger was a master of contrapuntal writing, and it is highly probable that this piano reduction incorporates intricate voice leading, even within its thick harmonic textures.
*   **Motivic Development:** His works often feature rigorous thematic and motivic development, a hallmark of the German tradition he inherited.

### 5. Conclusion

Max Reger's *Sechs Burlesken*, Op. 58, No. 4, as represented by this MIDI analysis, stands as a testament to the expressive and structural capabilities of **expanded functional tonality** at the turn of the 20th century. While an initial D-flat major key signature is provided, the music consistently challenges a singular tonal center through pervasive chromaticism, frequent use of altered and extended harmonies, and rapid excursions into distantly related harmonic regions. The piece achieves a "pan-tonal" character where all twelve pitch classes are heavily utilized, yet without abandoning underlying tonal principles of root movement and harmonic tension-release that define functional harmony.

The analysis definitively confirms the absence of any strict twelve-tone or serial organization, placing the work firmly within the late Romantic and early modernist paradigms that preceded dodecaphony. Its form is likely a compact ternary structure (ABA') with an expansive coda, articulated by clear shifts in time signature and highly flexible tempo indications, which contribute to its characteristic "burlesque" expressiveness. Reger's Op. 58, No. 4, therefore, exemplifies the culmination of German Romantic chromaticism, pushing tonal boundaries to their limits while maintaining a rich, complex, and fundamentally tonal identity.
